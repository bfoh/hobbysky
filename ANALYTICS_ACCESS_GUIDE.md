## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows "No data available"
**Solution**: You need bookings in your system. Create some test bookings first.

### Charts not rendering
**Solution**: Refresh the page. Charts load after data fetches.

### Can't access analytics
**Solution**: Check your role. Only Owner/Admin/Manager can access.

### Data seems incorrect
**Solution**: Analytics pulls from live bookings. Verify booking data is correct.

### Page loading slowly
**Solution**: Normal on first load. Subsequent loads use cache.
